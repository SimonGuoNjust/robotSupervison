# Robot Supervision Code Library

## Introduction
The `robot` code library is designed for managing device connections and processing video and point cloud data in robotics and networked applications. It facilitates communication between devices using UDP and TCP protocols, while also providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing video streams and point cloud data.

## Get Started
To install and use the `robot` code library, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Boost
- PCL (Point Cloud Library)
- FFmpeg
- OpenCV
- Qt framework

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd robot
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using your package manager or build them from source.

3. Build the project using CMake:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
   
## Feature
The `robot` code library supports the following main features:

- **Device Connection Management**: Establishes and manages connections to devices using UDP and TCP protocols.
- **Video Streaming**: Captures and processes video streams using FFmpeg and OpenCV, allowing real-time video rendering.
- **Point Cloud Visualization**: Decodes and visualizes point cloud data, enabling 3D data representation and analysis.

## Implementation
The library consists of several key files:

- **connect.cpp**: Implements the `Connector` class for managing UDP and TCP communications, handling device discovery and connection management.
  
- **main.cpp**: Serves as the entry point for the Qt application, initializing the main window and starting the event loop.

- **mainwindow.cpp**: Implements the `MainWindow` class, managing the GUI components, video streaming, and point cloud visualization. It connects various components through signals and slots.

- **pcdecoder.cpp**: Implements the `PointCloudDecoder` class, responsible for decoding point cloud data received over TCP, utilizing PCL's compression methods.

- **pullStream.cpp**: Implements the `pullStreamWorker` class, which processes video streams using FFmpeg and OpenCV, capturing and rendering video frames.

## Acknowledgement
This code library utilizes several external third-party libraries:

- **Boost**: Provides portable C++ libraries for tasks such as networking and threading.
- **PCL (Point Cloud Library)**: A comprehensive library for 2D/3D image and point cloud processing.
- **FFmpeg**: A powerful multimedia framework for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams.
- **OpenCV**: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.
